# GovtProcurement

Objective of project:
- Create a tool which other team members can use to analyse trends in Government Procurement, based on 2015 data and future data.
- Identify high value add procurement opportunities which currently go to foreign companies, but could have gone to local companies.
- Identify insights behind trends in government procurement (e.g. which part of the year do most procurements take place?)
